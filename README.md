- **Fraudulent Documents**: Over 200,000 fraudulent documents detected.
- **Current Challenges**: Existing verification methods are unreliable, costly, and dependent on foreign technology.

### **Research Findings**
- **Fraud Detection**: The prevalence of fraudulent documents emphasizes the need for better verification systems.
- **Financial Burden**: Investigating fraudulent documents is expensive and reliant on foreign technologies.

### **Project Objective**
- **Proactive Solution**: Develop a software system to track educational documents from issuance.
- **Verification Interface**: Offer an easy-to-use interface for organizations and institutions to verify documents.
- **Digital Traceability**: Link educational documents to national ID numbers for reliable verification.

### **Benefits**
- **Reliability**: A dependable verification process that reduces reliance on foreign tech.
- **Burden Reduction**: Alleviates the burden on institutions by reducing fraudulent documents.
- **Efficiency**: Streamlines the verification of educational qualifications.

### **Implementation Vision**
- **Integration with National ID System**: Enhance traceability by linking documents to national ID numbers.
- **Software Solution**: A robust system for tracking and verifying educational documents.
